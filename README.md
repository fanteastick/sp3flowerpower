# What is this app?
This app is designed to raise awareness about the large amount of waste generated by feminine hygiene products.
These products go directly into our landfills and eventually cause harm to our planet.
Many women are unaware of the wide variety of sustainable alternatives they can use -- thus, this app was born.
The app features informational pages, and a small game about collecting sustainable products.
In addition, there are links and a small "shop" to buy sustainable products.

# How to run the app
This app was built with MIT app inventor. To run the app, import the .aia file to your app inventor. 
Install the app inventor app on your phone. Open the project in app inventor (in the browser) and find the option
to run the project on your device. Enter the code or scan the qr code on your phone, and the app should 
be able to run.

# Other details
